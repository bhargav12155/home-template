# AWS Deployment Issues - FIXED! ðŸŽ‰

## Problem Summary

The AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment was failing due to:

1. **Missing Replit packages**: The server was trying to import `@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal` in production
2. **Incorrect port configuration**: Server was defaulting to port 5000 instead of 8081 expected by AWS
3. **Template saving API failing**: These issues prevented the server from starting

## Root Cause Analysis

From the AWS logs you provided:

```
Error: Cannot find module '@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal'
Connection refused (port 8081)
```

The server couldn't start because:

- Replit development packages were being imported unconditionally
- Port was misconfigured for AWS environment

## Fixes Applied âœ…

### 1. Fixed Replit Package Imports

**File**: `vite.config.ts`

- Made Replit imports conditional (development + REPL_ID environment only)
- Wrapped imports in try-catch blocks to prevent crashes

### 2. Fixed Server Port Configuration

**File**: `server/index.ts`

- Changed default port from 5080 to 8081 for AWS production
- Kept 5080 for local development
- Updated bind address to 0.0.0.0 for AWS compatibility

### 3. Updated Deployment Package

**File**: `aws-deploy-v2-lite/index.js`

- Fixed the bundled deployment file with correct port (8081)
- Removed unconditional Replit imports
- Made all imports conditional for production safety

## New Deployment Package

ðŸ“¦ **`bjork-homes-aws-deployment-FIXED.tar.gz`**

This package contains all the fixes and should resolve the deployment issues.

## How to Deploy

1. **Upload the new package**: Use `bjork-homes-aws-deployment-FIXED.tar.gz`
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure these are set in AWS:

   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `PORT=8081` (AWS will set this automatically)

3. **Test the deployment**: The template saving functionality should now work

## What's Different

### Before (Broken):

```javascript
// Always imported Replit packages
import runtimeErrorOverlay from "@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal";

// Wrong port for AWS
const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT || "5000", 10);
```

### After (Fixed):

```javascript
// Conditional imports for development only
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development" && process.env.REPL_ID) {
  // Import Replit packages safely
}

// Correct port for AWS
const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT || "8081", 10);
```

## Expected Result

- âœ… Server starts successfully on AWS
- âœ… Template saving API works
- âœ… All features functional
- âœ… No more "Connection refused" errors

The deployment should now work correctly and your template saving functionality will be restored!
