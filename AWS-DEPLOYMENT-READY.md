# ðŸš€ AWS DEPLOYMENT READY - Production Version

## âœ… What's Been Fixed & Implemented

### Multi-Tenant Template System

- **User Isolation**: Each user has their own template data (user-3, user-4, etc.)
- **Public Template Endpoint**: `/api/template/public?user=X` for accessing user-specific templates
- **Placeholder System**: Professional stock images and content for new users

### S3 Integration (CRITICAL FIX)

- **Public Bucket Policy**: Fixed S3 permissions - all uploaded images now publicly accessible
- **Automatic Cleanup**: 1-file-per-folder policy prevents S3 accumulation
- **Video Support**: Hero videos upload and display with priority over images

### Template Features

- **Hero Video/Image Priority**: Video takes precedence when both exist
- **Agent Image Display**: Fixed and working (was the main issue)
- **Professional Placeholders**: High-quality stock images from Unsplash
- **Mutual Exclusion Uploads**: Clean UI for managing hero content

## ðŸ”§ Deployment Configuration

### AWS Environment Requirements

```bash
# Required Environment Variables for AWS:
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
S3_BUCKET_NAME=home-template-images
DATABASE_URL=your-rds-connection-string
NODE_ENV=production
```

### S3 Bucket Setup (COMPLETED)

- âœ… Bucket: `home-template-images` in `us-east-2`
- âœ… Public read policy applied
- âœ… Folder structure: `heroes/user-X/`, `agents/user-X/`, `logos/user-X/`

### Database Schema

- âœ… Multi-tenant templates table with user isolation
- âœ… All image URLs stored as S3 public URLs
- âœ… Placeholder fallback system in application layer

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features Working

1. **Multi-Tenant Routing**: Users get their own template via `?user=X` parameter
2. **Image Upload & Display**: All image types (hero, agent, logo) working
3. **Video Upload**: Hero videos with proper validation and cleanup
4. **Responsive Design**: Professional real estate template
5. **Placeholder System**: New users see professional content immediately

## ðŸš€ Ready for AWS Deployment

The codebase is now production-ready with:

- âœ… Fixed S3 permissions (main blocker resolved)
- âœ… Multi-tenant template system
- âœ… Professional placeholder content
- âœ… Video upload functionality
- âœ… Automatic S3 cleanup system
- âœ… User isolation and data security

**Branch**: `features-cleanup` is ready for deployment
**Commit**: `b5a35aa` - Production-ready deployment with multi-tenant template system

### Next Steps for AWS:

1. Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk or ECS
2. Configure RDS database connection
3. Set environment variables
4. S3 bucket already configured and working

The application is fully functional and ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
