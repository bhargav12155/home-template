# Video Hosting for Your Luxury Real Estate Website

## üö® Why Video Was Removed from Deployment

Your deployment package was 45MB because of one 40MB video file. This is too large for efficient AWS deployment and causes:
- Slow uploads to AWS
- Longer deployment times  
- Higher bandwidth costs
- Poor user experience

## ‚úÖ Better Video Hosting Solutions

### Option 1: AWS S3 + CloudFront (Recommended)
1. Upload video to S3 bucket
2. Enable CloudFront CDN
3. Update your website to use S3 URL
4. **Benefits**: Fast global delivery, automatic compression

### Option 2: YouTube/Vimeo Embedding
1. Upload video to YouTube or Vimeo
2. Embed using iframe or video component
3. **Benefits**: Free hosting, automatic optimization

### Option 3: Professional Video CDN
- **Cloudinary**: Automatic video optimization
- **JW Player**: Professional video hosting
- **Wistia**: Business-focused video hosting

## üìù Quick Fix for Your Website

In your React components, change video source from local file to hosted URL:

```jsx
// Instead of local video file:
<video src="/assets/video.mp4" />

// Use hosted video:
<video src="https://your-cdn.com/luxury-home-video.mp4" />
```

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

**Local hosting (in deployment):**
- 45MB package uploads every deployment
- Slow website loading
- High bandwidth costs

**S3 + CloudFront:**
- ~$1-5/month for video hosting
- Fast global delivery
- 2MB deployment package
- Much better user experience

**Bottom line**: Host videos externally, keep deployment packages small!
